Status of IIO development
-------------------------


HIGH PRIORITY:

* Add missing cases for TIFF reader:
  - compressed tiles with multiple channels
  - non-compressed strips with multiple channels
  - compressed bitlengths not multiple of 8 (e.g. 12 bits)

* Add JPEG2000 reader (not very interesting in itself, but a good stepping
  stone towards adding it into fancy_image)

* Fix the TXT reader so that it is usable without env vars (requires heuristics)



MEDIUM PRIORITY:

* Write fortran interface

* Re-think python interface (should the output number type depend on the input
  file?)

* Sligthly more powerful magic filename language

* Optimize sixel output



LOW PRIORITY:

* Provide stripped-down versions of iio.c with fewer or no dependencies
  (maybe with user-selectable dependency choice?)

* Write tiff reader by hand, eliminate libtiff dependency

* Develop the usage and interface for 3d images

* Develop the usage for ``1d images'' (signals and unordered point clouds)
